todo:
	-look at spek (vala spectrogram)
	-insert: dupe-checking not working.
	-can only dnd one file from filemanager onto database window.
	-appears to freeze when importing from cdrom. move to idle function?
	-GtkInfBar added in gtk 2.18 - we should probably use it instead of the message_panel__ functions in window.c 
	-show warning icon in statusbar - eggtrayicon.c ?
	-freshly imported files dont have the icon set.
	-check out libsexy SexyUrlLabel (for tags) 
	-check out chickensys samplemanage.
	-recursive importing: gui is unresponsive - put in some mainloop stuff
	-check with valgrind.
	-how to programmatically enter treeview cell edit mode? (see code)
	-why segfaults related to tree row_refs - see dir_tree_on_link_selected() 
	-ffmpeg: look at aqualung to see how they do the FFmpeg support.
	-add date to database so we can sort by date and show f-spot style bar chart for years.
	-make samplecat an embeddable widget?
	-player: look at sndfile-jackplay (in sndfile-tools)
	-consider using libavformat from ffmpeg to get info for mp3/mp4 etc. see `ffprobe` for example-code.

metadata:
	-gio/gvfs:
		-try g_file_query_info() using the 'metadata' namespace
		-uses different store to tracker! designed to be faster.
		-gio/gvfs metadata breaks mv etc, as it will use the metadata. You are supposed to use 'gvfs-move'.
			-the proper way to do this is to use xattrs, which are supported by the filesystem, however Nautilus guy says they are too slow.
		-what metadata will gio/gvfs give us?
			-custom icon
			-per-folder default view
			-per-folder background
			-per folder (spatial) geometry
			-per folder icon view and list view settings (colums, zoom level, etc)
			-icon position in manual layout mode (e.g. on desktop)
			-icon scaling
			-emblems
			-file annotations (a note you can add on a file)
			note: thumbnails are stored in another way (see thumbnail spec)
		-evince uses gfvs-metadata.

removable media:
	-currently we (probably?) dont store the volume name.
	-you can get a (UUID) volume name using libudev.

file system trees:
	-the first implementation was based on devhelp and worked ok, but didnt do too much.
	-second implementation used gqview's gtkclist implemtation - aborted due to implementation of gtktreeview theming into gtk2.10.
	-3rd implementation uses gqviews gtktreeview imlementation - not yet finished.

-databases:
	-mysql has an 'embedded' mode, ie it can be used without a daemon. Ideally it would be nice to support this. Used by Amarok for example.

-commercial competitors:
	-soundminer: http://www.soundminer.com/SM_Site/Home.html
	-chickensys samplemanage
	-AudioFinder
	-Netmix - http://www.netmixpro.com/

-auditioning
	-perhaps use the dssi sampleplayer plugin like sonicvisualiser does?

-portability
	-like all systems using a central database, the data is confined to one machine. If you scp or take disk to another machine, all your data is effectively lost.
	-if a file is moved, its metadata is lost! (could maybe have a find function?)
