todo:
 v0.2:
	-db-backend: rename/move files, update basic info (dir, name, duration, ..)
  -file-manager: hook rename/move files -> db-backend
	-db-backend: add 'misc' field for collected format specific meta-data (eg Artist, Album, bitrate, sf2 sample-count, etc)
 v0.4:
  -update mysql backend to new data-model
	-file-manager: rmdir/mkdir, unlink+confirm

sometime:
  -use GDL docking widgets
	-major GUI redesign
  -update tracker backend 0.10 , new values in data-model
	-look at spek (vala spectrogram) - why? sndfile's spectrogram is great
	-appears to freeze when importing from cdrom. move to idle function?
	-GtkInfBar added in gtk 2.18 - we should probably use it instead of the message_panel__ functions in window.c 
	-show warning icon in statusbar - eggtrayicon.c ?
	-check out libsexy SexyUrlLabel (for tags) 
	-check out chickensys samplemanage.
	-recursive importing: gui is unresponsive - put in some mainloop stuff
	-check with valgrind. - needs suppression file for gtk libs
	-how to programmatically enter treeview cell edit mode? (see code)
	-why segfaults related to tree row_refs - see dir_tree_on_link_selected()  -- possibly fixed already
	-add date to database so we can sort by date and show f-spot style bar chart for years. -- mtime already present in model
	-make samplecat an embeddable widget?
	-DnD out of samplecat on OSX to non GTK apps (it works with ardour, but not with OSX-Finder)
	-allow to modify preset-categories and remember changes.

metadata:
	-gio/gvfs:
		-try g_file_query_info() using the 'metadata' namespace
		-uses different store to tracker! designed to be faster.
		-gio/gvfs metadata breaks mv etc, as it will use the metadata. You are supposed to use 'gvfs-move'.
			-the proper way to do this is to use xattrs, which are supported by the filesystem, however Nautilus guy says they are too slow.
		-what metadata will gio/gvfs give us?
			-custom icon
			-per-folder default view
			-per-folder background
			-per folder (spatial) geometry
			-per folder icon view and list view settings (colums, zoom level, etc)
			-icon position in manual layout mode (e.g. on desktop)
			-icon scaling
			-emblems
			-file annotations (a note you can add on a file)
			note: thumbnails are stored in another way (see thumbnail spec)
		-evince uses gfvs-metadata.

removable media:
	-currently we (probably?) dont store the volume name.
	-you can get a (UUID) volume name using libudev.

file system trees:
	-the first implementation was based on devhelp and worked ok, but didnt do too much.
	-second implementation used gqview's gtkclist implemtation - aborted due to implementation of gtktreeview theming into gtk2.10.
	-3rd implementation uses gqviews gtktreeview imlementation - not yet finished.

-databases:
	-mysql has an 'embedded' mode, ie it can be used without a daemon. Ideally it would be nice to support this. Used by Amarok for example.
