todo:
 v0.2.X:
  -update old config-file s/database_/mysql_/
  -mysql backend: automatically create or alter database.
  -mysql backend: search - split by space, wildcards 
 v0.3.X:
  -file-manager: rmdir/mkdir, unlink+confirm
  -re-connect files when moved external to samplecat
   * search new file 
   * mass-updates
   * compare md5sum ? or compare already known audio-properties (frames, peaklevel)
  -fix dnotify/inotify code - it does not seem to do anything.

sometime:
  -minor GUI redesign:
   * make "play" move obvious: tooltip on waveform, play-icon overlay?
   * move "loop" from menu->pref to player_control.
   * make use of the two status-bars.
  -major GUI redesign.
   * use GDL docking widgets
   * flexible, configurable list-view
   * preferences and about windows
   * fix focus-save behaviour of notes and tag-edit in inspector.
   * add button and/or shortcut to reset colours of played files.
  -merge w/ latest geeqie/gqview and ROX code
  -fix compiler warnings in file manager code. remove cruft.
  -select and expand prev folder in dir-tree-view (bottom-left) on startup.
  -update tracker backend 0.10 , new values in data-model
  -look at spek (vala spectrogram) -- but why? sndfile's spectrogram is great :)
  -appears to freeze when importing from cdrom. move to idle function?
  -GtkInfBar added in gtk 2.18 - we should probably use it instead of the message_panel__ functions in window.c 
  -show warning icon in statusbar - eggtrayicon.c ?
  -check out libsexy SexyUrlLabel (for tags) 
  -check out chickensys samplemanage.
  -recursive importing: gui is unresponsive - put in some mainloop stuff
  -check with valgrind. - needs suppression file for gtk libs
  -how to programmatically enter treeview cell edit mode? (see code)
  -why segfaults related to tree row_refs - see dir_tree_on_link_selected()  -- possibly fixed already
  -add date to database so we can sort by date and show f-spot style bar chart for years. -- mtime already present in model
  -make samplecat an embeddable widget?
  -DnD out of samplecat on OSX to non GTK apps (it works with ardour, but not with OSX-Finder)
  -allow to modify preset-categories and remember changes.
  -better meta_data handling and meta-data edit.
  -add support for sample-libs (sf2, etc).
  -ffmpge decoder: parse and set bit_depth.
  -move player-code into sub-directory src/audio_players/ ?

metadata:
  -gio/gvfs:
    -try g_file_query_info() using the 'metadata' namespace
    -uses different store to tracker! designed to be faster.
    -gio/gvfs metadata breaks mv etc, as it will use the metadata. You are supposed to use 'gvfs-move'.
      -the proper way to do this is to use xattrs, which are supported by the filesystem, however Nautilus guy says they are too slow.
    -what metadata will gio/gvfs give us?
      -custom icon
      -per-folder default view
      -per-folder background
      -per folder (spatial) geometry
      -per folder icon view and list view settings (colums, zoom level, etc)
      -icon position in manual layout mode (e.g. on desktop)
      -icon scaling
      -emblems
      -file annotations (a note you can add on a file)
      note: thumbnails are stored in another way (see thumbnail spec)
    -evince uses gfvs-metadata.

removable media:
  -currently we (probably?) dont store the volume name.
  -you can get a (UUID) volume name using libudev.

file system trees:
  -the first implementation was based on devhelp and worked ok, but didnt do too much.
  -second implementation used gqview's gtkclist implemtation - aborted due to implementation of gtktreeview theming into gtk2.10.
  -3rd implementation uses gqviews gtktreeview imlementation - not yet finished.

-databases:
  -mysql has an 'embedded' mode, ie it can be used without a daemon. Ideally it would be nice to support this. Used by Amarok for example.
