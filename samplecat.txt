todo:
	-insert: dupe-checking not working.
	-appears to freeze when importing from cdrom. move to idle function?
	-GtkInfBar added in gtk 2.18 - we should probably use it instead of the message_panel__ functions in window.c 
	-show warning icon in statusbar - eggtrayicon.c ?
	-freshly imported files dont have the icon set.
	-check out libsexy SexyUrlLabel (for tags) 
	-check out chickensys samplemanage.
	-recursive importing: gui is unresponsive - put in some mainloop stuff
	-check with valgrind.
	-how to programmatically enter treeview cell edit mode? (see code)
	-why segfaults related to tree row_refs - see dir_tree_on_link_selected() 
	-ffmpeg: look at aqualung to see how they do the FFmpeg support.
	-add date to database so we can sort by date and show f-spot style bar chart for years.
	-make samplecat an embeddable widget?

file system trees:
	-the first implementation was based on devhelp and worked ok, but didnt do too much.
	-second implementation used gqview's gtkclist implemtation - aborted due to implementation of gtktreeview theming into gtk2.10.
	-3rd implementation uses gqviews gtktreeview imlementation - not yet finished.
