samplecat installation
----------------------

Please report any problems to tim@orford.org


1 - configure, make, make install.

2 - if you are using Mysql, you need to setup the database.
    (Sqlite setup is done automatically)

    The datbase schema is contained in the file samples.sql
    You can import this by runnig the command:

    mysql -u<USERNAME> -p < samples.sql

3 - running the program will create a default config file 
    (~/.config/samplecat/samplecat) that you should edit with
    your db access info.
