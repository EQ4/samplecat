SampleCat is a program for cataloguing and auditioning audio samples.

SampleCat is available under the GNU General Public License and runs mainly on
GNU/Linux systems. It is written in C and uses the GTK graphics library. 
MySql is used for the database.

Currently, basic functionality is working, but the application lacks the bells 
and whistles to make it a serious tool.


known issues:
-------------
-samplecat will crash when trying to read a directory containing broken links.
