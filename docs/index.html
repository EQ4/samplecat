<h1>SampleCat</h1>

<p>
SampleCat is a program for cataloguing and auditioning audio samples.
</p>
<p>
SampleCat is available under the GNU General Public License and runs mainly on
GNU/Linux systems. It is written in C and uses the GTK graphics library. 
MySql is used for the database.
</p>
<p>
Currently, basic functionality is working, but the application lacks the bells and whistles to make it a serious tool.
</p>
<p>
<strong>20080809</strong>: Added display of simple metadata for current filemanager selection. Version changed to 0.0.5
</p>
<p>
<strong>20080505</strong>: Added some minor functionality to the filemanager context menu.
</p>
<p>
<strong>20070922</strong>: Fixed dnd import bug, and added some more simple file management functionality.
</p>
<p>
<strong>20070907</strong>: Gnome-vfs dependency removed. Initial support for moving and copying samples added.
</p>
<p>
<strong>20070906</strong>: Problems reported linking against libart, so libart has been removed as a dependency. Drawing is now done with Cairo. Tarball updated.
</p>

  <li>catalogues 'offline' (eg cdrom), as well as 'online' sample files.
  <li>supported filetypes are wav, flac, aiff, sd2, etc, via libsndfile.
  <li>metadata stored: filename, path, samplerate, channels, mimetype, and a small waveform overview.
  <li>freeform tagging.

<h3>usage</h3>
<ul>

  <li>if a file is currently mounted, an icon will be shown in the main table. Select Update on the context menu to refresh its status.
  <li>set tags by 1) selecting Edit Tags on the context menu, 2) double clicking the tag area, 3) enter text in the Edit box at the top of the window and hit the "Set Category" button.
  <li>to move a file in the filesystem, drag it from the main list to a directory in the directory tree on the left.

</ul>

<h3>limitations</h3>
